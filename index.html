            <span>Hello my love</span> They say if you love someone you let them go,honestly im too selfish to do that. Why should i let go to the one person i care about.
                  Im not going to lie,i knew falling in love with you will end up with me getting hurt,but i was too in love to not take a chance on you,a chance on us. But looking back, you re-arranged my life in ways i didnt know, i fell so in love,i could not expalain. I fell in love with everything about you. Your eyes,the way you look at me,i fall in love everytime i look at them. And your smile,your smile takes me out everytime. I think about it everyday,every moment.I wish i could see it all day.I still feel your lips tracing my skin mapping its territories and i actually love that feeling on my body. I love every part of you,i hope you know that. I know you said you needed time,and so im gonna wait until you are ready to be mine. I know i beg you not to leave,but if you want to go i will gladly let you go. I know I said im selfish to let you go,but for you I would do anything since i love you more.
